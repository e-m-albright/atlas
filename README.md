# Amnesia

## Impediments to Remembering

1. Encoding failures - we don't learn the information in the first place
2. ðŸ¥³ Decay - memories fade over time
3. Inadequate retrieval cues - we lack sufficient reminders
4. Interference - other memories get in the way
5. Trying not to remember - we deliberately attempt to keep things out of mind
