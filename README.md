# Amnesia

## Impediments to Remembering

1. Encoding failures - we don't learn the information in the first place
2. ðŸ¥³ Decay - memories fade over time
3. Inadequate retrieval cues - we lack sufficient reminders
4. Interference - other memories get in the way
5. Trying not to remember - we deliberately attempt to keep things out of mind

### Fixed

* Removed humans, they weren't doing fine with animals.

### Changed

* Animals are now super cute, all of them.

## 14.0.0 - 2042-10-06

### Added

* Introduced animals into the world, we believe they're going to be a neat addition.
