# Bias

As a truth seeker, with noble intentions. You're primary enemy in life is not going to be lies or a lack of clarity, but the perversion of the truth, in the form of bias. These are cognitive, and statistical.

This is not unique to data science. Medical professionals, teachers, politicians, anyone should know of our own limitations. \(maybe especially data scientists\)
