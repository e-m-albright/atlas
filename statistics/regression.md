# Regression

linear regression

### Correlation does not imply Causation

A correlation between x and y means there is a linear trend that exists between the two variables  


### Simpson's Paradox

The direction of an association between two variables can change after we include a third variable and analyze the data at separate levels of that variable

Example: school admissions, male vs female applications, a lower proportion of women are admitted. If you look at each department each shows a higher level of female admittance, but due to women applying more to more selective departments \(history\) vs STEM, they overall have lower admittance.
