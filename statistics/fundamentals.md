# Fundamentals

#### **Variable**

A characteristic which varies over time or in different entities under consideration

#### **Experimental Unit**

The entity on which a variable is measured 

**Population**

The set of all measurements of interest to the investigator

#### Sample

The subset of measurements selected from the population of interest

#### **Qualitative Variables // Categorical Data**

Measure a quality or characteristic on each experimental unit

#### **Quantitative Variables // Numerical Data**

Measure a numerical quantity or amount on each experimental unit  


**Discrete: A finite or countable number of values**

**Continuous: Infinitely many values**

**Identifiers**

**Help associate the measurements to the experimental units**

**Don't accidentally try to analyze these**

**Univariate Data**

**A single variable measured on a single experimental unit**

**Bivariate, Multivariate Data**

**Two variables measured on a single experimental unit.**

**Parameter**

**Numerical descriptive measures associated with a population of measurements**

**Statistics**

**Parameters computed from sample measurements**  


**Descriptive**

**Methods for organizing, displaying, and describing data by using tables, graphs, and summary measures**

**Inferential**

**Methods that use sample results to help make decisions or predictions about a population \(inference, inferring general rules about the population from a sample\)**  


**Margin of error - samples usually differ from the true population by some margin**  


**Sampling**

**random sample - avoid bias**

**simple random sampling**  


**random / cluster / stratisfied / systematic sampling**  


**coverage bias \(who can reply\), warning bias \(phrasing in questions\), no response bias \(who answers surveys\)**  


**frequency = real count**

**relative frequencies = response / sample size**

**percentage = relative frequency \* 100**
