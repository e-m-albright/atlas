Graph



channels / modes



low level tasks

find largest, sort, find outliers



marks \(like a point on a scatter plot\) can encode multiple dimensions through visual channels like shape, texture, size, color, luminosity, hue, angle, position



psycho sensitivity

hue, electricity, weight, etc, all relations of real change in input stimulus to perceived change



intensity response

number of effective channels

common visualizations, purposes \(EDA, quantity, etc\)

good online references: ...



Bar charts

Pareto diagram \(ordered bar chart?\)



dot plot - 1d scatter

scatter plot - 2d? \(maybe 3d\)



box plot

violin plot



pie chart



histograms - distribution

- range of values, frequencies, shape \(symmetric /skewed\)

- modality \(peaks?\)





number of classes for distributions

typically should be between 5-15

Sturge's Formula can also suggest a good number. 1 + 3.3log\(n\)
