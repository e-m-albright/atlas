## Read



&lt;!--td {border: 1px solid \#ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--&gt;

|  | Mistborn \(trilogy\) | Brandon Sanderson | Fantasy | Super hard to get through 2nd book, dialogue is so fucking awful |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | Powdermage \(trilogy\) |  | Fantasy | Promising start but turned to waste of time, was entertaining to almost the end |
|  | Gentlemen Bastards \(series\) |  | Fantasy | Great, superb start, couldn't really go anywhere with later books and it felt repetitive fast |
|  | Wizards First Rule \(series\) |  | Fantasy | Think I enjoyed it mostly, pretty dumb and didn't shape up well, not worth reading more in the series. |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Kitchen Confidential | Anthony Bourdain | Biography | I get it was a splash at the time, but it doesn't hold up well at all. Easy-ish read though so whatever. |
|  | Scrappy Little Nobody | Anna Kendrick | Biography | Fun, didn't really get any good advice or insight from it, but eh. |
|  | Bossypants | Tina Fey | Biography | I really like Tina Fey. don't recall reading this much but I think it was intriguing as well as fun |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Good Omens | Terry Pratchett + Neil Gaiman |  | Fun-ish but I thought it was kind of lame |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Don't Shoot the Dog | Karen Pryor |  | behavioral modification training with positive reinforcement, looks super promising |
|  | No Sweat |  |  | help rethinking relation to habits, viewing them as chores or gifts to derive energy, especially in terms of exercise industry, for sustainable habits and improvemen |
|  | Bigger Leaner Stronger | Michael Matthews |  | Exercise/lifestyle adjustments |
|  | The Best We Could Do |  | Graphic Novel, Biography | Was interesting to a degree, nice insight into vietnamese immigration story, but overall didn't much care for it and it was nothing ... this sounds cruel but - nothing I didn't already know or wouldn't have guessed. Easy read so whatever. |
| Hall of Fame |  |  |  |  |
|  | Title | Author | Genre | Notes |
|  | Sabriel \(series\) | Garth Nix | Fantasy |  |
|  |  | Garth Nix |  | Think I read another dystopian one by him I loved, not sure I need more of him though |
|  | Blade Itself | Joe Abercrombie | Fantasy | Pretty fun grim-dark style, I went through the audiobook |
|  | Witcher \(series\) |  | Fantasy | Not always super good but enough of it was fun and I liked the memory of listening to it while driving down from Seattle |
|  | Game of Thrones | George R. R. Martin | Fantasy | Slow as balls and not well written, but the characters and the world are too fun to ignore |
|  | Belgariad |  | Fantasy | Loved it so much when I was younger, probably not a good idea to revisit but it was magical and so reassuring to me when I really needed the fantasy. Plus the scope and journey was so goddamn captivating |
|  |  | Piers Antony | Fantasy | Same as belgariad, this dude is a little out there but his series on the aspects of war/time/death and the sex android series were just, so fucking fun and intriguing, and perhaps found at the exact right time of my life |
|  | V for Vendetta |  | Graphic Novel, Sci-fi | Really good, just really goddamn good and culture shaping |
|  | Watchmen |  | Graphic Novel, Sci-fi | Incredible. So good. |
|  | His Dark Materials | Phillip Pullman | Fantasy | Fuck me, this was a wonderful fantasy for me just when I needed it. Top fucking notch YA fiction. |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| Hall of Shame, a.k.a. gave the fuck up on this doodoo |  |  |  |  |
|  | Title | Author | Genre | Notes |
|  | Name of the wind |  | Fantasy | fucking slow and stupid start |
|  | Wheel of time |  | Fantasy | fucking slow and stupid start |
|  | Prince of thorns |  | Fantasy | I respect the risk but I hated this book |
|  | Discworld \(series\) | Terry Pratchett | Fantasy | Read Color of Magic and honesty didn't care for it, wasn't that funny |
|  | IT | Steven King | Horror | Probably not the book's fault but the audiobook is just a boring shitty mess to get through |
|  | Dark Towers \(series\) | Steven King |  | Goddamn this was just boring to get through, didn't finish first book |
